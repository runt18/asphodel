# Contribution guidelines

This document describes a set of conventions to follow to keep our code organised and consistent.

## Java style
- Everyone hates style guides but let's try and agree on some things to keep things tidy

## Git usage
- Do all development in a branch with a name that describes the feature you are working on
- Submit a pull request to merge it into master when it is finished
- Test things before merging - the code in the master branch shoud always pass all unit tests and compile and run correctly
